#SQL Mini Projects
This repository contains a collection of small SQL projects that demonstrate the creation and management of various databases using SQL. Each .sql file contains the necessary SQL commands to create tables, insert data, and perform basic operations related to different management systems.

##Projects Overview
1. Library Management System
File: Library Management.sql

This project simulates a library management system where you can track:

Authors: Basic details of authors whose books are available in the library.
Books: Information on available books including their title, author, and publication year.
Book Loans: Records of book loans, including borrower details and the loan/return dates.
Key SQL Concepts:
CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, and SELECT
Foreign key relationships to link books and authors
Querying loans based on dates and borrower information

## 2. Railway System Management
File: Railway system.sql

This project models a simple railway management system where you can:

Stations: Manage different stations in the system.
Trains: Track trains running between stations with their schedules.
Passengers: Record passenger information and their ticket bookings.
Key SQL Concepts:
Schema design for trains, stations, and passengers
Joining data between trains and passenger bookings
Use of primary and foreign keys to enforce relationships


##3. Sales and Customer Tracking System
File: sales and customer.sql

This project focuses on managing:

Customers: Basic customer details such as name and email.
Products: A catalog of products available for purchase, with pricing information.
Sales: Records of sales transactions, including the customer, product purchased, quantity, and sale date.
Key SQL Concepts:
Managing sales data using foreign key relationships
Aggregate queries to calculate total sales or quantity sold
Tracking customer purchases over time


##4. Student Management System
File: student Management system.sql

This project models a basic student management system where:

Students: Records of student details such as name, age, and enrollment date.
Courses: A list of available courses with course codes and instructor details.
Enrollments: The courses students are enrolled in, tracked by enrollment date.
Key SQL Concepts:
Using relational tables to manage students, courses, and enrollments
Aggregating data to calculate enrollment counts
Querying course enrollments based on student and course IDs
How to Use
Download the desired .sql file.
Execute the SQL script in any SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
Review the database schema and sample data created by the script.
Run queries to test the functionality of the system.
